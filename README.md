# Movie-Ontology
Semantic Understanding and Processing: The system can parse natural language queries such as "Recommend movies similar to 'Inception'" or "Comedy films starring Jim Carrey from the 1990s," identifying entities (movies, actors, directors, years) and user intentions (similar recommendations, conditional filtering).  

Ontology-Driven Associative Retrieval: Based on the constructed movie ontology (OWL), the system can understand and utilize semantic relationships like 'director directs movie,' 'actor stars in movie,' and 'movie belongs to a certain genre' for precise retrieval, rather than simple keyword matching.  

Prototype System Interaction: Provides a running prototype with basic features such as a search box and results display (e.g., a web interface), allowing users to experience the semantic search process firsthand.  

In Terms of Quality:  

Accuracy: Evaluated through small-scale user testing and metrics like Precision/Recall, demonstrating that ontology-based search improves result relevance compared to traditional keyword search.  

Usability and Demonstrability: The prototype system should run stably and have a clear interface, intuitively showcasing the core advantages of semantic search to support graduation project demonstration and evaluation.  

Focus and Feasibility: As an undergraduate graduation project, the system should focus on a specific, limited domain of movies, ensuring that ontology construction and prototype development can be completed within the project timeline.
